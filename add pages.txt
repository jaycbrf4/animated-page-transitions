If you want to load other pages properly you need to update your page, style.css as well as main.js.
For example if you are using a page called contacts.html, then change this line
<body class="cd-about"> to <body class="cd-contacts"> and this line <div class="cd-about cd-main-content"> to <div class="cd-contacts cd-main-content">.

Because, in main.js the file name is used to create a section. Similarly in the main.js look for the line ( section.hasClass('cd-about') ) ? $('body').addClass('cd-about') : $('body').removeClass('cd-about'); and add another one just below it,
( section.hasClass('cd-contacts') ) ? $('body').addClass('cd-contacts') : $('body').removeClass('cd-contacts');

Now in style.css, search for all the classes that have .cd-about copy and paste them at the bottom and replace cd-about with cd-contacts. (Mind you this is only for the newly copy pasted one) so, you will have two sets of classes, one for about and one for contacts.

And you are done. Repeat this process for all the pages you add. remember the section name is your-page-name minus the extension, which is html.
